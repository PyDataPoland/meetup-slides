#Slides from PyData Warsaw 15 - 06.06.2018

##Andrzej Sułecki, NVIDIA Polska - “Architecture is not everything. How to train better networks in less time.”
Machine learning community focuses more on network architecture than on optimizing the training process.
Most of the recent state of the art ImageNet networks still use almost the same training hyperparameters as original ResNet paper from 2015.
Recent findings suggest that we can do much better, saving time and money, and get better models as a result.

##Mariusz Wołoszyn - "Project Cardigan - Deep Learning Based Image Retrieval"
Visual Image retrieval is the only successful way to find useful information in many domains that lack rich textual description. Project Cardigan is using the latest developments in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and distributed computing to build a complex solution for image retrieval and product recommendation mainly (but not only) targeted at fashion products and e-commerce. It's name is derived from stylish sweater worn by elegant gentlemen. :)

##Adriano Oliveira - "The challenges of card fraud prevention"
Adriano is going to introduce the main concepts about card fraud. He realises it's something everyone have heard about but almost no one knows how it works. Then Adriano will explain how businesses do in general to prevent fraud, what to measure, the key concepts, etc. And lastly he will talk about his experiences in applying machine learning to the problem, the challenges and caveats. It's not a deep technical talk, but we hope it has lots of good insights for machine learning people about the fraud domain.
